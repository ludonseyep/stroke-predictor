    "Using our critical thinking, we decided that ID and residence type attributes for example are unlikely to influence the patient probability of having a stroke. This allowed to reduce the amount of noise created by the additional data and improve the predictivity of the to be chosen model. \n",

    "age, high cholesterol and obesity (bmi), diabetes (average glucose level), smoking (smoking status, hypertension).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Factors that may have an effect on the likeliness of a stroke were still included to evaluate their potential impact on the predictivity of the chosen model (marital status, work type, intense stress,hypertension, and employment type). "

    "We chose Random Forest because it is one of the non-parametric classifiers that gives the highest accuracy (Over 90%). The model works so well because of the low correlation between some of the attributes (bmi and age for example) ,  the trees protect each other from their individual errors. While some trees may be wrong, many other trees will be right, so as a group, the trees are able to move in the correct direction. Some advantages of Random Forest against other classifiers include: \n",
    "- It is insensitive to noise or overtraining, which shows the ability in dealing with our unbalanced data.\n",
    "- Trees can accurately divide the data based on Categorical Variables ( not linear regression).\n",
    "\t\n",
    "With the selected feature scaling, this model proved to be a good candidate compared to other potential modelling techniques such as Logistic Regression or KNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the importance of each attribute, the recall_micro cross validation scores were studied over each iteration. Recall_micro was chosen to count the total number of true positives, false negatives and false positives. This proved to be a good metric to use, as the most dangerous prediction would be to falsely diagnose that a patient will not have a stroke (false negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "10 cross validations folds were iterated to prevent overfitting of the data and obtain enough datapoints for the final interactive graph. Furthermore, k (nb of cross validation folds) needs not to be increased too much as both computational efficiency and number of datapoints in a single training set will be too low. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training fraction was chosen to be 80% in order to obtain the best possible model that will fit our data and prevent important variation of the obtained score. In this scenario, a greater training data quantity will give a better estimate of the stroke output however it must not be increased above this level (ie 90-10). This is because a 10% test set is too little to evaluate the final performance of the model. \n",
